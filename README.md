# ReactFundamentals

Here I will list all my followed steps into my 'react' adventure :-)
After finish, I will detail all steps one my one, with some explanations and hints to make easy understant more about react.
I start to save my progress at lesson 8, but I'll put 1-7 soon.

There is a branch for each lesson with all source code: https://github.com/LucasCaixeta/ReactFundamentals/branches

    Was created a Mixin component to be used by subcomponents (button and label). 
    Interesting to see how a single structure may be used to compose many other components, sharing the same behavior.
